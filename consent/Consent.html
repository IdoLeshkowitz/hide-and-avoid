        Welcome to the “Hiding” game experiment! Before we start, please respond to the informed consent form.

        <b>Informed consent form</b><br/>
        Principal Investigator: Yaakov Kareev<br/>

        <b>A. Project Description</b><br/>
        The game involves a set of boxes and a number of objects to be hidden in the boxes. Each box has a value by which the number of objects in the box will be multiplied (the box’ <b>multiplication rate</b>). You will play either as a “Hider” or as an “Opener”. If you are a Hider you will distribute the objects endowed to you across the boxes; if you are an Opener you will choose half of the boxes to be opened later. The Opener earns the value of the objects in the unopened boxes, the Hider earns the value of the objects in the opened boxes.<br/>
        Before the hiding and opening you will be asked to complete a brief test to make sure you understand the game. If you fail the test your participation will be terminated.<br/>
        After playing, you will be asked to answer a question about the game.
